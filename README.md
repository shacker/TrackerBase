# TrackerBase for BeOS

Back in the early-mid 90s, I ran The [BeOS Tip Server](http://betips.net) from a BeOS server in my home, using the Be Filesystem (BFS) as the database, since BFS provided completely customizable attributes for custom filetypes. 

The code was written in Perl (what was I thinking?) and is an embarassment by today's standards, but the whole project was a bit of a miracle at the time, and I'm happy to have done it. You can read more about the TrackerBase project [here](http://betips.net/trackerbase/).

I stopped using BeOS when the project was killed, and never went down the Haiku path. I recently discovered the original TrackerBase.pkg installer file, and found that I couldn't open it on the Mac. Fortunately, a [current Haiku user](https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/unpacking-an-old-pkg-file-without-haiku/8171/4) came to my rescue (thanks @humdinger!) and unpacked it for me. I'm posting it here on github just to keep the code alive and accessible to anyone wants it.
