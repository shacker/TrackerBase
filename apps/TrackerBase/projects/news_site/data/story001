The judging must have been mighty tight at this year's Be Masters Awards ceremony. When all was said and done, Be themselves took home the majority of the prizes for innovation, flexibility, and good taste. According to one spokesperson, "It was hard handing the prizes back to ourselves, and we don't want to slight anyone, but hey, we deserved it."
