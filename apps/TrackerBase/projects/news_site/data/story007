Anyone who has a suggestion about R4 should  tell Be now,  as they 
will enter the Gold stage in  about 3 weeks. Thats when they make  the first 
CDs. So basically everything  should  be  there by then<br><br> 

R4 will be very different code wise,  so there won't  be  a download 
version like  for  R3.1 as that would  be too  big. <br><br> 

The first  steps for  inernationalization are taken. The BeMenus will 
be  editable OS whide to make  a german, dutch, or whatever BeOS version possible. Thats less then 400 
words so  everyone with  a little  time and a dictionary should  be  able to 
do that. (quote  from Alex Osadzinski)<br><br> 

Maxon is  in  pre  Alpha Stage  but already rocks. The MAXON guy 
really liked  it and said he can do  a  lot more with the BeOS that he can not do anywhere 
else. <br><br> 

Also in  the next month to 6 month Be.  Inc.  hopes to be able to announce 
some  support  by major brand names in the sound  market :)  The  sound 
people really have troubles with Win and Mac as they are at the OS'es 
limits. They really like the possibilities of the BeOS.<br><Br>
