StyledEdit doesn't provide a convenient menu option or hotkey to quickly toggle text to bold or italics. However, it completely supports these variants when they're built into your fonts. If you're typing in Humnst and want to create bold or italic text, just select your text normally, pull down the Fonts menu, and scroll to Humnst, then over to bold or italic. It's a bit of a pain, but hey, you still can't do that in Notepad or SimpleText!
