You can turn your People folder into an instant Rolodex.  Open the People 
folder, and on the Tracker's Attributes menu unselect all of the default attributes.  
<P>
Now go to the bottom of the list and select only attributes under 
the Person sub-menu.  Contact Name, Email Address, Home Phone, Work 
Phone and Group gives you a good working list for all your contacts.  
<P>
The layout can be arranged more by sliding column header to created 
the order you like.  Of course clicking on any column header will 
sort by Group or Phone Number for easy browsing.  Since Tracker remembers every aspect of every folder's layout, your customizations will still be there when you return.

Enjoy!
