As of R4, you no longer have to launch the Workspaces preferences panel to move windows from one workspace to another. Just click and hold on the title tab of the window in question while pressing the usual workspace-switching hotkey. For example, if the browser window in which you're viewing this tip is in workspace #1 and you want to move it to workspace #3, click and hold on the browser's title tab and press Alt+F3.
