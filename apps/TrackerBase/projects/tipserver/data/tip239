The yellow title tabs on BeOS windows are arguably the most distinctive feature of the user interface. If you're not particularly impressed with them though, or if you're just nostalgiac for the UI of a lesser OS, you can easily change them to that of MacOS, AmigaOS, or Windows 95. Hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift and access the Be menu -- you'll see a previously hidden entry there labeled Window Decor, from which you can access any of these operating systems' window styles.
