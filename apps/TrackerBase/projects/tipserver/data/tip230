Have you ever wanted to filter your BeMail into a given folder after downloading?</p>

<p>Although Be's built-in Find function is powerful and can be run from the command line (see <a href="/cgi-bin/chunga.pl?ID=tip176">Queries from Terminal</a>), the problem with querying BeMail is that you can't query all the attibutes you might like (e.g., &quot;CC:&quot;).

<p>The following BASH script queries for my new mail and then greps it for a search word, in this case, &quot;beusertalk.&quot; Then it moves the results to a target folder, in this example, into the &quot;New&quot; folder (/boot/home/mail/BeUserTalk/New/). Although it is far from being fool-proof, it more or less gets the job done.

<p>The second problem I ran into was automating the process, so that the filter ran when I got new mail.  After a number of unsatisfactory attempts, I finally decided to on the following solution.

<p>I named this script &quot;mailbox&quot; and placed it in my &quot;mail&quot; folder, /boot/home/mail/. (You probably have a simlink in there now called &quot;mailbox&quot; that links to the &quot;in&quot; folder). Now whenever I double-click on the mailbox in the Deskbar, it runs the script instead of opening my &quot;in&quot; folder.  To complete the process, if it moved new beusertalk mail into the New folder it opens it up and then the last line of the script opens my in box.

<PRE>
#!/bin/sh

targetfolder=$HOME/mail/BeUserTalk/New/
searchword=beusertalk

movedmail=no

# just check new mail
newmail=$(query "((MAIL:status=='*[nN][eE][wW]*')&&(BEOS:TYPE=='text/x-email'))")


# iterate throw files while temporarily replacing spaces 
# with backslashes so that it only splits at the newline
for i in ${newmail// /\\}; do
	# replace backlashes with spaces again
	file="${i//\\/ }"
	
	# if file contain the searched-for word, then move it to target folder
	if grep -ic "$searchword" "$file"; then
		filename="${file##/*/}"
		if [ ! -e "$targetfolder$filename" ]; then
			mv "$file" "$targetfolder"
			movedmail=yes
		fi
	fi
done

# open in folder
/boot/beos/system/Tracker $HOME/mail/in

# open $target folder if mail is moved there.
if [ "$movedmail" = yes ]; then
	/boot/beos/system/Tracker "$targetfolder"
fi

</PRE>

<p>One word of warning: If this script ends up moving a bunch of files, it might take a second or two before your &quot;in&quot; folder actually opens.  You can move this line to the beginning of the script, if you don't mind watching your email disappear.
