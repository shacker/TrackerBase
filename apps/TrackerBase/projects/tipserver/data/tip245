The title tabs on all BeOS windows appear flush-left on every window by default. If you need to get a title tab out of the way quickly, hold down the Shift key and drag your tabs left of right. What could this possibly be good for? You can now use your title tabs to arrange a sequence of windows as if they were tabs on manila folders, to toggle quickly amongst an array of open document  or Tracker windows, for example.
