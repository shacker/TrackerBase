If your CD-ROM audio cable is connected to your sound card, you don't need a BeOS audio driver for your sound card to play audio CDs. Heck, you don't even need to have the media_server or media_addon_server running :)
<P>
Open up a terminal window and use the "play" program (as described in the tip <a href="/cgi-bin/chunga.pl?ID=tip141">Rip CDs from the command line</a>).
<P>
So to start playing a CD you would type:

<pre>play (your device) 0 (track number to start at)</pre>

Just typing <tt>play</tt> with no arguments will tell you which devices are valid.

<P>
Alternatively, you can play CDs without an audio driver if you start them from within Windows:
<oI>
<li>Boot Windows 95</li>

<li> Start playing the audio CD and close the CD player. The  playback sholid continue...</li>

<li>Launch BeOS from Windows using the "Launch BeOS" utility. 
Normally, you should still hear the CD playing.</li>

<li>Launch the CD player -- that's it ! You can even change CDs.  The CDs will stay "playable" as long as you don't reboot.</li>
</ol>
