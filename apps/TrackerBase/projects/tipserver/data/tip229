If you have multiple BFS partions on your system, you may only want some of them 
to show up at boot time rather than all of them. Solution:
<p>
Add lines similar to these to your system's user-level startup script: <BR>
/boot/home/config/boot/UserBootScript
<pre>
/bin/mountvolume -unmount /BeFast BeFast
/bin/mountvolume -unmount /no\ name no\ name
</pre>
The \ 's are because these volumes have spaces in their names which need to be escaped.
BeFast and no name are the volume names...
<P>
Hope that helps your clutter.  ;)
