LEONARDO: I have been informed that this boat is sinking.
<P>
KATE: That is terrible.
<P>
LEONARDO: Would you like to engage in some more immoral-but-justified behavior?
<P>
KATE: Certainly.
<P>
WEASELLY FIANCE: Excuse me, I --
<P>
AUDIENCE: Boo! Boo!
<P>
WEASELLY FIANCE: (aside) I'm getting the raw end of the deal here. (to Leonardo) Listen, Leonardo, to cement my morally-dubious-yet-somehow-less-annoying-than-you personality, I am going to handcuff you to this pipe, here in a room that will soon be filling with water, due to the fact that we are sinking, which I believe has been mentioned
previously.
<P>
LEONARDO: Why don't you just shoot me?
<P>
WEASELLY FIANCE: Because then you wouldn't be able to escape and save Kate from me. Of course, you're going to die
anyway--
<P>
AUDIENCE: Don't spoil it for us! Boo!
<P>
LEONARDO: He's right, though. I am doomed.
<P>
AUDIENCE: Aww, look how cute he is when he's doomed.
<P>
WEASELLY FIANCE: I hate you people.
