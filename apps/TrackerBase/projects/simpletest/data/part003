LEONARDO: I'm glad we snuck away like this so that you could cheat on your fiance.
<P>
KATE: So am I. Even though I am engaged to him and have made a commitment to marry him, that is no reason why you and I cannot climb into the backseat of a car and steam up the windows together. The fact that I am the heroine of the movie will no doubt help the cattle-like audience forgive me of this, though they would probably be VERY angry indeed if my fiance were to do the same thing to
me.
<P>
AUDIENCE: Darn straight we would! Moo! We mean, Boo!
<P>
LEONARDO: I agree. First I would like to draw you, though, so of course you will have to take off all your
clothes.
<P>
KATE: But can a movie with five minutes of continuous nudity be at all successful in, say, Provo, Utah, where the audiences might not stand for that sort of
thing?
<P>
LEONARDO: I would be willing to bet that for the first three weeks the film is in release, every single showing at Wynnsong Theater in Provo will sell
out.
<P>
NARRATOR: According to Wynnsong manager Matt Palmer, that is exactly what happened.
<P>
KATE: All right, then. (sound of clothes hitting the floor)
