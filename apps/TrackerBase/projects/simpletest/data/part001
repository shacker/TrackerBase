"Clash of the Titanic" by Eric D. Snider Published in The Daily Universe on February 9, 1998
<P>
Many of you have seen the film "Titanic," which is about a great big boat that sank like a thousand years ago that for some reason everyone is just now getting worked up about. Some of you -- I am speaking to the  women here -- have seen this movie several times. And I would like to know why.  Have the principles of film-making not been adequately explained to you, so you think there's a chance the movie will end differently if you see it again?  Do you think this is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" movie?  Because it's not.  No matter how many times you see it, the boat is going to sink, and the same people are going to die, including the guy who falls and whacks his noggin on the railing on the way
down.

I think this movie is entirely too long. The actual sinking of the Titanic took only four hours; the movie is easily three times that long.  Therefore, as a public service, I am offering my much-shortened screenplay which some ambitious film-maker can feel free to use as the script for a shorter version of "Titanic." All I want in return is a lot of money.
